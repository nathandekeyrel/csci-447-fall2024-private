# CSCI 447 - Machine Learning

A collection of fundamental machine learning algorithm implementations.

## Projects

This repository contains implementations, from scratch, for the following algorithms:

1.  **Naive Bayes:**
    *   Implementation of the Naive Bayes classifier.

2.  **k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN):**
    *   Implementation of the kNN algorithm for classification/regression.
    *   Compares with kNN-Clustered using K-Means

3.  **Neural Network (Backpropagation):**
    *   A basic Neural Network trained using the standard backpropagation algorithm.

4.  **Neural Network (Population-Based):**
    *   Neural Networks trained using optimization algorithms instead of standard gradient descent. Includes:
        *   Genetic Algorithm (GA)
        *   Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
        *   Differential Evolution (DE)
